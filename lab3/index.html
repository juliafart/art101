			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer!</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We have to create a webpage for Lab 3 with a partner and post our screenshots here. In order for internet users and those who will be grading our work to see the website, we must also make sure that we know how to "push" the changes we make in our code editor onto our webpage!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had problems organizing my images in files because once they were in files i couldn't figure out how to mention them in my code correctly leading to my images not appearing correcting in my website.</p>
					<p> Other than that I was just worried about imputting the correct screenshots because I was a little confused about what screenshots were asked for.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had a lot of fun on this lab, I really enjoyed the time to personalize our website and make it reflect our personality. I like that this is something I can constantly change and work at just like me! :P </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I really like my homepage and I am excited to add to it more!! </p>
