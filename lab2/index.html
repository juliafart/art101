					<h2> My HTML intro!!</h2>
					<p> My partner Elise is really cool! I think she has a very cool style and I enjoy all of her efforts during our partner work! :> </p>
					<p> This assignment helped me practice my usage of HTML and CSS. It helped me learn how to ask others for help and use the W3 Schools site.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I just struggled to remeber what the coding tags were and my solution to that was going to the W3 Schools webpage.  </p>
					<p> I also struggled with uploading and editing photos onto my website. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I feel like this assignment went very well considering how worried I was about it. I put a lot of energy into this assignment because I know that the effort I put in can literally be visually seen.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> As a result of this assignment I got a lot of editing of my website published and it was very empowering to see just how much I have learned and can do.</p>
