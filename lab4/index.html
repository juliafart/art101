					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> This assignment forced us to practice Pseudocoding and how that looks as a start to JavaScript. Learning the patterns or form of javascript through practicing pseudocoding with fun tasks.</p>

<p> CARD MATCHING GAME
	POSSIBLE CARD ICONS:
BAT
PUMPKIN
WITCH-HAT
WEBS
	Create user as “Player” and create game as “Computer” 
	One face-down card is displayed in front of the player. 
	Four face-up cards are layered in front of the player's face-down card.
	Player selects from the four face-up card icons. 
	The player guesses which icon will appear on the face-down card.
	Face down card flips over to reveal icon.
	If cards do not match, 1 point is gained for the computer.
	If cards do not match, the turned over cards reset.
	If cards do match, player gains one point.
	If cards do match, the turned over card resets.
	Point totals are tallied
	Cards reset and replaced with different order of cards.
	User wins or loses after 5 turns 
	Game point tallies reset back to 0 and all cards reset

Pseudocode:
	1. // Print the five cards (with each icon)
	2. // Accept user input
	3. // Validate user move
	4.//  Evaluate if the cards match
	5. // Tally round points
	6. // Choose computer move
	7. // Test of win or draw condition
</p>
