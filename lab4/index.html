			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> This assignment forced us to practice Pseudocoding and how that looks as a start to JavaScript. Learning the patterns or form of javascript through practicing pseudocoding with fun tasks.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had problems with formatting whether it was learning how to correctly format </p>

<p> CARD MATCHING GAME
-------------------------------
	POSSIBLE CARD ICONS:

BAT

<p>
	Create user as “Player” and create game as “Computer”
	<br> One face-down card is displayed in front of the player. 
	<br> Four face-up cards are layered in front of the player's face-down card. 
	<br> Player selects from the four face-up card icons. 
	<br> The player guesses which icon will appear on the face-down card.
	<br> Face down card flips over to reveal icon.
	<br> If cards do not match, 1 point is gained for the computer.
	<br> If cards do not match, the turned over cards reset.
	<br> If cards do match, player gains one point.
	<br> If cards do match, the turned over card resets.
	<br> Point totals are tallied
	<br> Cards reset and replaced with different order of cards.
	<br> User wins or loses after 5 turns 
	<br> Game point tallies reset back to 0 and all cards reset

<br>Pseudocode:
	<br>1. // Print the five cards (with each icon)
	<br>2. // Accept user input
	<br>3. // Validate user move
	<br>4.//  Evaluate if the cards match
	<br>5. // Tally round points
	<br>6. // Choose computer move
	<br>7. // Test of win or draw condition
</p> 
<pre><code>
