                <p> ... i never really cared for harry potter. I read so many of the books and watched the movies and I never really enjoyed it. Then everyone found out JK Rowling is a shithead so maybe I just have wonderful taste.</p>

                <p> I kept finding problems in my code and having to fix them. Other than that I really enjoyed this assignment! 
                    <br> I had a big BOO BOO because I inputted a video that was over 100 GB and Github didn't really like that. I couldn't just delete the video either. Even after I deleted the file and removed all code calling that file, yet I still couldn't push any of my changes to the orgin. It was very upsetting and I had to ask Wes for help after class. :0
