					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with my partner, Elise, we had to experiment with basic Javascript datat types and variables. We used the example of a car of our choice.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I was confused about the formatting in JavaScript and how correct my formating had to be to display on my site correctly. I asked around to clarify how to format my JavaScript page, which helped me a lot.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I really liked this Lab and I liked the customizable part of it. I like Mazada Miatas and I liked being able to do an assignment on a car of my choosing. I thought my partner, Elise and I continued to work well together to get this assignment done. I tried my best to produce quality work that visiualizes my efforts.</p>
