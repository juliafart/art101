			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays & Objects!! </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this assignment was working with javascript to produce arrays and objects. Through these practices it will be easier to memorize the patterns of javascript to better understand how these functions will work later.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I got confused about how to put my code correctly and how to then imput it in the console. Yet, I asked my wonderful partner, Elise, and she helped me better understand what the instructions/tasks where asking of me.<br>
					Overally I was able to understand it and correctly imput my code therefore helping me better learn the patterns.</p>
