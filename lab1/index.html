					<h2>Description of Lab 1</h2>
					<p> This Lab was about researching other websites in detail and thinking about what we like from the different websites. We had to think deeper to think why the game or website designer made it this way and how we could possibly use this in our own website.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> There weren't any problems with this lab, if anything I found this lab very interesting and very universal because everyone can find something they like and find interesting. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I really enjoyed this assignemnt. I liked going to different sites and really trying to think about what I deem as interesting. 
				<br>I put extra effort into this assignmet because I tried to look at extra websites to see if there are other more intesting details that I enjoy. 
				<br>I also enjoyed working with my partner and looking at the websites they chose and why they were interesting to them.</p>
