            <h2> Challenge</h2>
                <p> With my partner, Elise we used our debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.
                    <br> Although both Elise and I didn't have much to inherently "fix" in our old labs. </p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> I didn't really have any problems at all with this lab. I have already gone back and fixed all the labs that I had to debug because I didn't like working on new labs knowing something was wrong with my lab. 
                    <br> I think that is a very anal thing I do quite often where I can't move past something unless it is the way I want it. </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> Elise and I both edited old labs to make them look more "put together". I added a icon to my homepage and I added flex boxes so that my links maximized space.</p>
