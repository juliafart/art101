				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> Per usual, there were some minor problems that arose. Yet, once again, I asked my wonderful partner, Elise. She helped me work through the issues I had and how to solve what I was doing wrong so I learn from it.<br>
				Overall, being able to meet up and talk about what went wrong was very helpful and I really enjoy having Elise as a partner.</p>
